# Tetra Master Calculator 

### Caculator for the card mini-game in Final Fantasy IX

I got really tired of trying to figure out why this mini game felt so weird to play. So I made a calculator in Rust to help me figure out the odds easier.

## Installation instructions
```bash
cargo install tetra-master-calc
```

## Exectute instructions
```bash
tetra-master-calc <attacker> <defender>
```
Ex: not case sensitive
```bash
tetra-master-calc 2m54 aa95
```
